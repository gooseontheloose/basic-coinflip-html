## Description

The Coin Flip App provides an interactive user interface where users can perform the following actions:

- **Coin Flip:** Click the "Flip the Coin" button to simulate flipping a coin. The result (Heads or Tails) is displayed, and statistics are updated accordingly.

- **Statistics:** The app keeps track of various statistics, including the number of flips, heads, tails, correct guesses, and wrong guesses for the current session.

- **Data Persistence:** The app uses local storage to save and retrieve statistics even after refreshing or closing the browser window.
